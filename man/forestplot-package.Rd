\description{
The forest plot function, \code{\link[=forestplot]{forestplot()}}, is a more general
version of the original \pkg{rmeta}-packages \code{forestplot}
implementation. The aim is at using forest plots for more than
just meta-analyses.
}
\details{
The forestplot:
\enumerate{
\item Allows for multiple confidence intervals per row
\item Custom fonts for each text element
\item Custom confidence intervals
\item Text mixed with expressions
\item Legends both on top/left of the plot and within the graph
\item Custom line height including auto-adapt height
\item Graph width that auto-adapts
\item Flexible arguments
\item and more
}
}
\section{Additional functions}{


The \code{\link{getTicks}} tries to format ticks for plots in a nicer way.
The major use is for exponential form where ticks are generated using the
\eqn{2^n} since a doubling is a concept easy to grasp for less mathematical-savvy
readers.

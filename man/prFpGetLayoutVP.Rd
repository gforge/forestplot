\title{Get the main `forestplot`}
\usage{
prFpGetLayoutVP(lineheight, labels, legend_layout = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{lineheight}{Height of the graph. By default this is \code{auto} and adjusts to the
space that is left after adjusting for x-axis size and legend. Sometimes
it might be desirable to set the line height to a certain height, for
instance if you have several forestplots you may want to standardize their
line height, then you set this variable to a certain height, note this should
be provided as a \code{\link[grid]{unit}} object. A good option
is to set the line height to \code{unit(2, "cm")}. A third option
is to set line height to "lines" and then you get 50 \% more than what the
text height is as your line height}

\item{labels}{The labels}

\item{legend_layout}{A legend layout object if applicable}
}
\value{
\code{viewport} Returns the `viewport` needed
}
\description{
The layout makes space for a legend if needed
}

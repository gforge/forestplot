\title{Gets the x-axis range}
\usage{
prFpXrange(upper, lower, clip, zero, xticks, xlog)
}
\arguments{
\item{upper}{The upper bound of the confidence interval for the forestplot, needs
to be the same format as the mean.}

\item{lower}{The lower bound of the confidence interval for the forestplot, needs
to be the same format as the mean.}

\item{clip}{Lower and upper limits for clipping confidence intervals to arrows}

\item{zero}{x-axis coordinate for zero line. If you provide a vector of length 2 it
will print a rectangle instead of just a line. If you provide NA the line is suppressed.}

\item{xticks}{Optional user-specified x-axis tick marks. Specify NULL to use
the defaults, numeric(0) to omit the x-axis. By adding a labels-attribute,
\code{attr(my_ticks, "labels") <- ...} you can dictate the outputted text
at each tick. If you specify a boolean vector then ticks indicated with
FALSE wont be printed. Note that the labels have to be the same length
as the main variable.}

\item{xlog}{If TRUE, x-axis tick marks are to follow a logarithmic scale, e.g. for
logistic regression (OR), survival estimates (HR), Poisson regression etc.
\emph{Note:} This is an intentional break with the original \code{forestplot}
function as I've found that exponentiated ticks/clips/zero effect are more
difficult to for non-statisticians and there are sometimes issues with rounding
the tick marks properly.}
}
\value{
\code{vector} Contains a min and max value
}
\description{
If the borders are smaller than the upper/lower limits
then clip the graph. The line will have arrows indicating
that it continues beyond the graph The zero bar has to
be on the chart though!

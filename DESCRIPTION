Description: The forestplot package allows the creation of forest plots
    with advanced features, such as multiple confidence intervals per row,
    customizable fonts for individual text elements, and flexible confidence
    interval drawing. It also supports mixing text with mathematical expressions.
    The package extends the application of forest plots beyond traditional meta-analyses,
    offering a more general version of the original `rmeta` packageâ€™s forestplot() function.
    It relies heavily on the 'grid' package for rendering the plots.

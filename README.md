# Forest plot package

The **forestplot** package enables the creation of advanced forest plots, offering features such as multiple confidence intervals per row, customizable fonts for individual text elements, and custom confidence interval drawing functions. Additionally, it supports text mixed with mathematical expressions, extending the use of forest plots beyond traditional meta-analyses. This package is a more general version of the original 'rmeta' package's forestplot function, with heavy reliance on the 'grid' package for graphical elements.
